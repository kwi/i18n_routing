= I18nRouting

I18n_routing is a plugin for Ruby on Rails that lets you easily translate your routes trough the I18n api included in Rails since version 2.2

All necessary informations are available on the wiki: http://wiki.github.com/kwi/i18n_routing

For any question, use the i18_routing google group: http://groups.google.com/group/i18n-routing

Works with Rails 2.3 and Rails 3.0
=> Rails3 beta and RC versions are no longer supported !

== IT House routing locale recognition
  
You can access current path locale through request.env["routing-locale"] and set it to I18n.locale.
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    before_filter :set_i18n_locale
    # to switch back to default locale
    after_filter :reset_i18n_locale

    def set_i18n_locale
      I18n.locale = request.env["routing-locale"] if I18n.available_locales.include?(request.env["routing-locale"].to_sym)
    end

    def reset_i18n_locale
      I18n.locale = I18n.default_locale
    end
  end

== TODO for next releases (written the 9th of June)

* Handle multiple translations for same resources name (Example: nested and not nested resources)
* Handle namespace translation (and path_prefix on Rails3)

== I18n gem version warning

Be careful when running Rails 2.3 with the shipped i18n gem: this is an old i18n version and i18_routing will install the latest i18n version as a gem.
This latest version may be incompatible with some old usages.
Furthermore, if the i18n gem is present on your system, Rails will load it and skip the shipped version; Keep that in mind.
